Hello, this is a test document to use in conjunction with the ReadBits Program. 

Simply open the a.exe(executable file) and when prompted to enter a file name, type this one in "sample".

The program will return its binary version of all this text to the console. You may erase the contents in here and write your own
or create your own .txt file and name it what you like. Just make sure the file uses the .txt extension and that the file exists in the 
same directory as the a.exe(executable file).

You may explore the source code to study and even download the zip file to play around with it. This repo will not accept any contributions, sorry.

Enjoy!
