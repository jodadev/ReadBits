Overview
--------------------------------------------
This program is a simple way to convert any .txt document's characters to binary 
machine code. You may use the packed .txt file "sample" to test the program 
or create your own .txt file. 
Enjoy!

NOTE: Your anti-virus may flag and prevent the program from running since it is 
not a official program. It is safe and you may exclude the program from your
anti-virus software if you feel comfortable. 


--------------------------------------------
Limitations
--------------------------------------------
    - Use .txt files only.
    - Ensure the .txt file you are attempting to convert is in the same directory
        as the a.exe(executable file) file or else it will not work!
