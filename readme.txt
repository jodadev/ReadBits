Overview
--------------------------------------------
This program is a simple way to convert any .txt document's characters to binary 
machine code. Alternatively you may choose to convert text directly within the 
console. If you choose to use a document you may use the .txt file "sample" 
or create your own .txt file. 
Enjoy!

NOTE: Your anti-virus may flag and prevent the program from running since it is 
not an official program. It is safe, you may exclude the program from your
anti-virus software if you feel comfortable. 


--------------------------------------------
Limitations
--------------------------------------------
    - Use .txt files only.
    - Ensure the .txt file you are attempting to convert is in the same directory
        as the ReadBits.exe(executable file) file or else it will not work!
