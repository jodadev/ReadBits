# ReadBits

## Overview

This console app is a simple way to convert any .txt document's characters to binary machine code. Alternatively you may choose to convert text directly within the console and have it displayed. If you choose to use a document, you may use
the .txt file packed in this repo entitled: "sample" or create your own .txt file. There are two options when converting to binary, one is to add a space in between each character binary or no space.

Enjoy!

**NOTE:** Your anti-virus may flag and prevent the app(.exe) from running since it is not an official app(.exe). It is safe. You may exclude the app(.exe) from your
anti-virus software, only if you feel comfortable.

## Limitations

- Must use .txt files only when using option 1 or 3 in menu.
- Ensure the .txt file you are attempting to convert is in the same directory
  as the ReadBits.exe(executable file) or else it will not work!
